The exercise is to create a simple web application where AJAX, JSON and DOM technologies are used.

You must use Javascript objects.

1. Create a blank page with the basic structure of HTML5 (html, head and body).
2. Charge the most popular YouTube videos using AJAX and parse the JSON.
3. Use your javascript objects to create a list with the title, description and picture of each video.
4. Add a link play(icon) above each image with the link of the video content (entry[x].content.src)
5. When click to play, replace the image to the embed element, using the value of the attribute href of the link as src of the "embed".
6. Apply a design of boxes.
X. Use the Dependency Injection pattern to change the source of videos easily.
